# pokemonU App

If you don't want to 'npm install' for yourself, the webpage is hosted on Heroku [here](https://pokemonu.herokuapp.com/). It might take a while to load because it's on a free tier Heroku dyno which sleeps after 30 minutes of no activity.

This project makes use of [the Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and the [pokeapi-js-wrapper](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper) to fetch and render basic Pokemon information from around the Poke-verse. pokemonU is built with React.js and Bootstrap 5.
